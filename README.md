- We have divided our code into different branches to seperate the different parts of our system
- Except for Flutter and the Master the other branches are only to have a look at and aren't necessarily functional

# Built with
* NodeJs
* TensorFlow
* Node-red
* MongoDB
* Flutter


# Getting started

- Clone this repo
- `npm install express mongoose mqtt --save` to install all required dependencies
- Install MongoDB Community Edition ([instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#tutorials)) and run it by executing `mongod`
- `node app.js` to start the local server
- Follow this ([tutorial](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local)) and install Node-RED locally on your machine.
- Import `Node-red/spotify_flow.json` into your Node-RED instance.
- Follow this ([tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)) and install Flutter locally on your machine.

# Overall Architecture
 
## Edge-device functionalities
The following diagram shows the functionalities of the browser which acts as our edge device.
